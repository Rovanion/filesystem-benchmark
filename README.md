# filesystem-benchmark

May or may not benchmark a file system. Things it might be
benchmarking instead includes:

* The kernel's ability to schedule threads.
* Java's file IO primitives in java.nio.

## Installation

Clone the source code from https://github.com/Rovanion/filesystem-benchmark, then compile a standalone jar-file using leiningen:

```
lein uberjar
```

You will now find a file named `target/uberjar/filesystem-benchmark-<VERSION>-standalone.jar` on your system ready for usage.

## Usage

You will need to add the following to `/etc/sudoers` through `visudo`:

```
<your username here>   ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/sysctl vm.drop_caches=3
```

Then run the uberjar with Java 8 or above:

```
java -jar target/uberjar/filesystem-benchmark-<VERSION>-standalone.jar --help
```

## Options

See --help output.

## Examples

```
java -jar target/uberjar/filesystem-benchmark-<VERSION>-standalone.jar --path .
```
